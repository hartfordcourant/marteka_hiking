                    <p class="first">The Branford Trail is a 28-mile perimeter trail around the shoreline town connecting town parks and land trust preserves. During my travels across the state, I've never seen it duplicated. And then I traveled to Groton and climbed aboard the Cross Town Trail — a miniature version of Branford's path.</p>
                    <p>The six-mile trail connects the waters of the Poquonnock River to Beebe Cove on Long Island Sound. In between, Cross Town connects two state parks, three land trust properties and a town park and preserve.</p>
                    <p>The best part about it? It remains in the coastal forest for most of the journey.</p>
                    <p class="last">Since I've written about both Bluff Point State Park and Haley Farm State Park in the past, I started my journey at the 88-acre Mortimer Wright Preserve along Groton Long Point Road. Although there are trails winding throughout the parcel, Cross Town — marked with bright blue blazes on trees — runs along the preserve's western boundary before linking up with the 75-acre Merritt Family Forest protected by the Groton Open Space Association. Both preserves are filled with small streams and woodlands with beech trees and cedar trees mixed with oaks. <span class="read"><a href="#">READ MORE</a></span></p>
